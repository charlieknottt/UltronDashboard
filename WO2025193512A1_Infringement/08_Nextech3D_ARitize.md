## Strength: MEDIUM-HIGH

Interesting target because they're a certified intermediary — they create infringing 3D content that ends up on Amazon, Google, Shopify. Publicly traded (easier to assess financials). They also claim their own "patented" 3D technology, which could create a counter-assertion risk but also confirms awareness of the technical field.
