# Hexa (formerly CGTrader Enterprise)
## Potential Infringement of WO/2025/193512A1

**Company:** Hexa 3D
**Product:** Hexa 3D Visualization Platform / HexaGen
**Status:** Commercial, $20.5M funded, serving Amazon, Crate & Barrel, Macy's

---

## How It Works

Hexa converts as little as one 2D image into a high-fidelity 3D asset using a human + AI pipeline. Uses dozens of AI algorithms built with PyTorch running on NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs.

**Pipeline:**
1. Input: As few as 1 product image
2. AI algorithms process image (PyTorch / NVIDIA GPUs)
3. 3D asset generated with photorealistic quality
4. Output: 360° viewable, AR-compatible 3D assets
5. Published to Amazon, retail websites

Used by major retailers for product visualization at scale.

## Claim Mapping

| Element | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| (a) Obtaining 2D image | "As little as one image to get started" |
| (b) Classifying object | Works across fashion, furniture, consumer electronics — classification implied |
| (c) Segmenting object | Object isolated for 3D reconstruction |
| (d) Dimensional sampling | 3D geometry extracted from 2D input |
| (e) Extracting texture | Photorealistic texture in output |
| (f) Generating 3D mesh | 3D asset generation (mesh-based for AR/web) |
| (g) Rendering texture onto mesh | Textured 3D renders for retail sites |
| Claim 5 (neural network) | "Dozens of AI algorithms" / PyTorch neural networks |
| Claim 9 (multiple views) | 360° viewing on retail websites |
| Claim 10 (user input) | Shoppers rotate products interactively |

## Strength: HIGH

Strong commercial target. Directly serves major US retailers (Amazon, Macy's, Crate & Barrel). Single-image-to-3D pipeline documented by NVIDIA. The retail/e-commerce focus aligns perfectly with the patent's grocery item claims (3-4). Accessible enforcement target compared to big tech.
