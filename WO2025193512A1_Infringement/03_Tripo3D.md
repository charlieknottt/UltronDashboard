# Tripo (Tripo3D)
## Potential Infringement of WO/2025/193512A1

**Company:** Tripo / VAST AI
**Product:** Tripo AI 3D Model Generator
**Status:** Commercial SaaS, 40M+ models generated, 3M+ users

---

## How It Works

Tripo converts a single image (JPG, PNG, WEBP) into a production-ready 3D model in seconds. Supports text, image, multi-view, and sketch inputs. Outputs GLB, FBX, OBJ, USD, STL.

**Pipeline:**
1. Input: Single image upload
2. AI processes image into 3D model with "sharp geometry and solid topology"
3. "Intelligent segmentation" splits models into structured, editable parts
4. 4K PBR-ready textures applied in one click
5. Interactive 3D viewer with rotation
6. Auto-rigging and animation available

## Claim Mapping

| Element | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| (a) Obtaining 2D image | Single image input (JPG/PNG/WEBP) |
| (b) Classifying object | Processes diverse object types — classification implied |
| (c) Segmenting object | "Intelligent segmentation" explicitly described |
| (d) Dimensional sampling | Sharp geometry extraction from 2D input |
| (e) Extracting texture | 4K PBR texture generation |
| (f) Generating 3D mesh | Explicit mesh with "solid topology," multiple export formats |
| (g) Rendering texture onto mesh | Textures rendered onto mesh |
| Claim 5 (neural network) | AI-based generation |
| Claim 9 (multiple views) | Interactive 3D viewer |
| Claim 10 (user input) | User rotation/manipulation |

## Strength: HIGH

40M+ models generated makes this a significant commercial operation. The pipeline directly maps to Claim 1. Tripo's explicit mention of "intelligent segmentation" is notable — it directly corresponds to claim element (c).
