## Claim 1 (Independent) — Elements to Map

| Element | Claim Language |
|---------|---------------|
| Preamble | A method for generating a 3D model comprising: |
| (a) | obtaining a 2D image of an object |
| (b) | classifying the object in the image |
| (c) | segmenting the object from the image |
| (d) | dimensionally sampling the segmented image of the object |
| (e) | extracting texture information from the segmented image |
| (f) | generating a 3D mesh model based at least on the dimensional sampling |
| (g) | rendering the texture information onto the 3D mesh model to create a 3D representation of the object |

## Key Dependent Claims

| Claim | Adds |
|-------|------|
| 2 | Classifier trained on plurality of object classes |
| 3-4 | Grocery items: bag, bottle, box, candy bag, packet |
| 5-6 | 3D mesh generated by trained neural network using dimensional samples + classification |
| 7-8 | Primary face texture rendered on opposite sides of mesh |
| 9 | Manipulating 3D representation to provide multiple views |
| 10 | Manipulation based on user input |
| 11 | Capturing a 2D image of each manipulation |
