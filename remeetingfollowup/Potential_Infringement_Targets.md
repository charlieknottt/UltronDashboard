## Recommended Enforcement Strategy

### Phase 1: Build Evidence (Current)
1. Complete Experian claim charts (already started)
2. Develop 2-3 additional EoUs from Tier 3 targets (Verkada, Clear, NCR)
3. Document public evidence from company websites, developer docs, marketing materials

### Phase 2: Initial Outreach
1. Send licensing inquiry letters to Tier 3 targets
2. Use early licenses to establish royalty benchmarks
3. Build war chest for larger enforcement

### Phase 3: Major Target Engagement
1. Approach Tier 1/2 with established licensing rate
2. Offer portfolio acquisition as alternative to licensing
3. Use litigation threat only after negotiation fails

### Alternative: Defensive Sale
- Present infringement analysis to potential acquirers
- Companies on this list may prefer to **buy the portfolio** rather than face enforcement
- Experian, Amazon, Meta most likely defensive buyers
